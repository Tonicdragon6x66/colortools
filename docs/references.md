- [*Finding Dominant Colour on an Image*](https://code.likeagirl.io/finding-dominant-colour-on-an-image-b4e075f98097). First solution I discovered for using k-means clustering to find the dominant colors in an image. Used to help build `kmeans` algorithm option in ColorTools. 
- [*Finding the dominant colors of an image*](https://www.timpoulsen.com/2018/finding-the-dominant-colors-of-an-image.html). Second example of using k-means clustering to find dominant colors in an image. Very similar to previous approach. Used to help build `kmeans` algorithm option in ColorTools. 
- [*baptiste0928 / dominant-color*](https://github.com/baptiste0928/dominant-color). Open source project for determining the dominant color of an image using a different, distribution-based approach. Used to help build `hue_dist` algorithm option in ColorTools. 
- [*How to package and deploy CLI applications with Python PyPA setuptools build*](https://pybit.es/articles/how-to-package-and-deploy-cli-apps/). Clear, readable tutorial for building/releasing pip packages.
